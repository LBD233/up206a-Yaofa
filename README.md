I am a first year master's student studying in the School of Civil Engineering. My main area of specialization is transportation engineering. As an undergraduate I had done my final year project on calculating flood hazards, and from then on I realized that I was interested in working with geographic data. I hope that through this class I can learn something about the calculation and editing of terrain data, road network data, and how to visualize it better.
