RPPL2016000925	3929 MALIBU VISTA DR., MALIBU (APN: 4443-003-012)Dear Mr. Quang Tran,The Department of Regional Planning has determined that the above-referenced project is not exempt from the requirements of the Santa Monica Mountains Local Implementation Program (LIP). Pursuant to County Code Section 22.40.820 (A)(1)(b)(i), the Department has determined that your project, which is a hillside retention system with pool, is not eligible for a Letter of Exemption because the project is within 50 feet of the edge of a coastal bluff. This proposed project would require the approval of a Minor Coastal Development Permit. This permit type is called for since, per County Code Section 22.44.1860, the project is within 200 feet of designated H1 habitat and therefore would require review by the Environmental Review Board (ERB). Furthermore, this proposed project would also require the approval of a Variance as the project does not meet the coastal bluff setback required by County Code Section 22.44.2180 (D). The Variance would need to be approved to authorize a reduction in this setback requirement.The applicant or other interested person may challenge the Director＊s determination and request the California Coastal Commission make a determination as to whether the proposed project is exempt or categorically excluded. The challenge period for this project will end at 5:00 p.m. on April 28, 2016. 	Determination Challenge:	To file a challenge, please contact:	Department of Regional Planning	320 W. Temple Street, 13th Floor	Los Angeles, CA 90012	Attention: Josh HuntingtonFor questions or for additional information, please contact Josh Huntington of the Zoning Permits West Section at 213-974-6462, or by email at jhuntington@planning.lacounty.gov.

			REVISED EXHIBIT A (REA) PERMIT NO. RPPL2016001044
			2241 East 89th Street, Florence-Firestone (APN: 6046-00-010)

Dear Mr. Diaz,

Regional Planning has DENIED REA Permit No. RPPL2016001044. Pursuant to the warning letter mailed to you on November 9, 2017, you were required to abate existing zoning violations on the property as outlined in the Notice of Violation, dated November 23, 2015 (NOV No. 15-00064000 - attached). Several site inspections of the property found no evidence that any violations have been abated. In addition, there has been no contact from you or the property owner regarding Regional Planning＊s November 9, 2017 warning that failure to abate existing violations would result in the denial of your project (attached). 

Additionally, Conditional Use Permit (CUP 200800125) was approved on Wednesday, June 16, 2010 with a list of conditions of approval for the property. You have failed to comply with these conditions of approval and consequently, your CUP has been placed on the Regional Planning Commission＊s discussion/possible action agenda on March 14, 2018 in order to initiate revocation of your CUP. Pursuant to Section 22.56.1780 et al. of the County Code, a permit can be revoked on the grounds that the person using the permit is violating or has violated any conditions of such permit, or that the use for which the permit is granted is being exercised contrary to the terms or conditions of approval, or in violation of any statute, ordinance law, or regulation. Staff is recommending that the revocation public hearing occur on April 25, 2018. 

For questions or for additional information, please contact Travis Seawards of the Zoning Permits West Section at (213) 974-6462, or by email at TSeawards@planning.lacounty.gov. Our office hours are Monday through Thursday, 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. We are closed on Fridays.
